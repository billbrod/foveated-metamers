class Metamer(Synthesis):
    r"""Synthesize metamers for image-computable differentiable models!

    Following the basic idea in [1]_, this module creates a metamer for a given
    model on a given image. We start with some random noise and iteratively
    adjust the pixel values so as to match the representation of the
    ``synthesized_signal`` and ``base_signal``. This is optimization though, so
    you'll probably need to experiment with the optimization hyper-parameters
    before you find a good solution.

    There are two types of objects you can pass as your models: torch.nn.Module
    or functions, which correspond to using a visual model or metric,
    respectively. See the `MAD_Competition` notebook for more details on this.

    All ``saved_`` attributes are initialized as empty lists and will be
    non-empty if the ``store_progress`` arg to ``synthesize()`` is not
    ``False``. They will be appended to on every iteration if
    ``store_progress=True`` or every ``store_progress`` iterations if it's an
    ``int``.

    All ``scales`` attributes will only be non-None if ``coarse_to_fine`` is
    not ``False``. See ``Metamer`` tutorial for more details.

    Parameters
    ----------
    base_signal : torch.Tensor or array_like
        A 4d tensor, this is the image whose representation we wish to
        match. If this is not a tensor, we try to cast it as one.
    model : torch.nn.Module or function
        A visual model or metric, see `MAD_Competition` notebook for more
        details
    loss_function : callable or None, optional
        the loss function to use to compare the representations of the
        models in order to determine their loss. Only used for the
        Module models, ignored otherwise. If None, we use the default:
        the element-wise 2-norm. See `MAD_Competition` notebook for more
        details
    model_kwargs :
        if model is a function (that is, you're using a metric instead
        of a model), then there might be additional arguments you want
        to pass it at run-time. Note that this means they will be passed
        on every call.

    Attributes
    ----------
    base_representation : torch.Tensor
        Whatever is returned by ``model(base_signal)``, this is
        what we match in order to create a metamer
    synthesized_signal : torch.Tensor
        The metamer. This may be unfinished depending on how many
        iterations we've run for.
    synthesized_represetation: torch.Tensor
        Whatever is returned by ``model(synthesized_signal)``; we're
        trying to make this identical to ``self.base_representation``
    seed : int
        Number with which we seeded pytorch and numpy's random number
        generators
    loss : list
        A list of our loss over iterations.
    gradient : list
        A list of the gradient over iterations.
    learning_rate : list
        A list of the learning_rate over iterations. We use a scheduler
        that gradually reduces this over time, so it won't be constant.
    pixel_change : list
        A list containing the max pixel change over iterations
        (``pixel_change[i]`` is the max pixel change in
        ``synthesized_signal`` between iterations ``i`` and ``i-1``). note
        this is calculated before any clamping, so may have some very
        large numbers in the beginning
    saved_signal : torch.Tensor or list
        Saved ``self.synthesized_signal`` for later examination.
    saved_representation : torch.Tensor or list
        Saved ``self.synthesized_representation`` for later examination.
    saved_signal_gradient : torch.Tensor or list
        Saved ``self.synthesized_signal.grad`` for later examination.
    saved_representation_gradient : torch.Tensor or list
        Saved ``self.synthesized_representation.grad`` for later examination.
    scales : list or None
        The list of scales in optimization order (i.e., from coarse to fine).
        Will be modified during the course of optimization.
    scales_loss : list or None
        The scale-specific loss at each iteration
    scales_timing : dict or None
        Keys are the values found in ``scales``, values are lists, specifying
        the iteration where we started and stopped optimizing this scale.
    scales_finished : list or None
        List of scales that we've finished optimizing.

        ``loss_thresh``, whichever comes first

        Parameters
        ----------
        initial_image : torch.Tensor, array_like, or None, optional
            The 4d tensor we use to initialize the metamer. If None (the
            default), we initialize with uniformly-distributed random
            noise lying between 0 and 1 or, if ``self.saved_signal`` is

            tensor or None, we try to cast it as a tensor.
        seed : int or None, optional
            Number with which to seed pytorch and numy's random number
            generators. If None, won't set the seed.
        max_iter : int, optinal
            The maximum number of iterations to run before we end
        learning_rate : float or None, optional
            The learning rate for our optimizer. None is only accepted
            if we're resuming synthesis, in which case we use the last
            learning rate from the previous instance.
        scheduler : bool, optional
            whether to initialize the scheduler or not. If False, the
            learning rate will never decrease.
        optimizer: {'GD', 'Adam', 'SGD', 'LBFGS', 'AdamW'}
            The choice of optimization algorithm. 'GD' is regular
            gradient descent.
        optimizer_kwargs : dict, optional
            Dictionary of keyword arguments to pass to the optimizer (in
            addition to learning_rate). What these should be depend on
            the specific optimizer you're using
        swa : bool, optional
            whether to use stochastic weight averaging or not
        swa_start : int, optional
            the iteration to start using stochastic weight iteration
        swa_freq : int, optional
            how frequently to update the parameters of the averaged model
        swa_lr : float, optional
            learning rate of the SWA
        clamper : plenoptic.Clamper or None, optional
            Clamper makes a change to the image in order to ensure that
            it stays reasonable. The classic example (and default
            option) is making sure the range lies between 0 and 1, see
            plenoptic.RangeClamper for an example.
        clamp_each_iter : bool, optional
            If True (and ``clamper`` is not ``None``), we clamp every
            iteration. If False, we only clamp at the very end, after
            the last iteration
        store_progress : bool or int, optional
            Whether we should store the representation of the metamer
            and the metamer image in progress on every iteration. If
            False, we don't save anything. If True, we save every
            iteration. If an int, we save every ``store_progress``
            iterations (note then that 0 is the same as False and 1 the
            same as True).
        save_progress : bool or int, optional
            Whether to save the metamer as we go. If True, we save to
            ``save_path`` every ``store_progress`` iterations. If an int, we
            save every ``save_progress`` iterations. Note that this can end up
            actually taking a fair amount of time.
        save_path : str, optional
            The path to save the synthesis-in-progress to (ignored if
            ``save_progress`` is False)
        loss_thresh : float, optional
            If the loss over the past ``loss_change_iter`` has changed
            less than ``loss_thresh``, we stop.
        loss_change_iter : int, optional
            How many iterations back to check in order to see if the
            loss has stopped decreasing in order to determine whether we
            should only calculate the gradient with respect to the
            ``loss_change_fraction`` fraction of statistics with
            the highest error.
        fraction_removed: float, optional
            The fraction of the representation that will be ignored
            when computing the loss. At every step the loss is computed
            using the remaining fraction of the representation only.
        loss_change_thresh : float, optional
            The threshold below which we consider the loss as unchanging
            in order to determine whether we should only calculate the
            gradient with respect to the
            ``loss_change_fraction`` fraction of statistics with
            the highest error.
        loss_change_fraction : float, optional
            If we think the loss has stopped decreasing (based on
            ``loss_change_iter`` and ``loss_change_thresh``), the
            fraction of the representation with the highest loss that we
            use to calculate the gradients
        coarse_to_fine : { 'together', 'separate', False}, optional
            If False, don't do coarse-to-fine optimization. Else, there
            are two options for how to do it:
            - 'together': start with the coarsest scale, then gradually
              add each finer scale.
            - 'separate': compute the gradient with respect to each
              scale separately (ignoring the others), then with respect
              to all of them at the end.
            (see ``Metamer`` tutorial for more details).
        clip_grad_norm : bool or float, optional
            Clip the gradient norm to avoid issues with numerical overflow.
            Gradient norm will be clipped to the specified value (True is
            equivalent to 1).

        Parameters
        ----------

            The path to load the Metamer object from

            When saving the synthesis object, we have the option to only

            we do that, then we need some way to construct that model
            again and, not knowing its class or anything, this object
            doesn't know how. Therefore, a user must pass a constructor
            for the model that takes in the ``state_dict_reduced``
            dictionary and returns the initialized model. See the
            PooledVentralStream class for an example of this.
        map_location : str, optional
            map_location argument to pass to ``torch.load``. If you save
            stuff that was being run on a GPU and are loading onto a
            CPU, you'll need this to make sure everything lines up
            properly. This should be structured like the str you would
            pass to ``torch.device``
        state_dict_kwargs :
            any additional kwargs will be added to the model's
            state_dict before construction (this only applies if the
            model is a dict, see above for more description of that)

        Returns
        -------
        metamer : plenoptic.synth.Metamer
            The loaded Metamer object


        Examples
        --------
        >>> metamer = po.synth.Metamer(img, model)
        >>> metamer.synthesize(max_iter=10, store_progress=True)
        >>> metamer.save('metamers.pt')
        >>> metamer_copy = po.synth.Metamer.load('metamers.pt')

        Things are slightly more complicated if you saved a reduced
        representation of the model by setting the
        ``save_model_reduced`` flag to ``True``. In that case, you also
        need to pass a model constructor argument, like so:

        >>> model = po.simul.PooledRGC(1)
        >>> metamer = po.synth.Metamer(img, model)
        >>> metamer.synthesize(max_iter=10, store_progress=True)
        >>> metamer.save('metamers.pt', save_model_reduced=True)
        >>> metamer_copy = po.synth.Metamer.load('metamers.pt',
                                                 model_constructor=po.simul.PooledRGC.from_state_dict_reduced)

        You may want to update one or more of the arguments used to
        initialize the model. The example I have in mind is where you
        run the metamer synthesis on a cluster but then load it on your
        local machine. The PooledVentralStream classes have a ``cache_dir``
        attribute which you will want to change so it finds the
        appropriate location:

        >>> model = po.simul.PooledRGC(1)
        >>> metamer = po.synth.Metamer(img, model)
        >>> metamer.synthesize(max_iter=10, store_progress=True)
        >>> metamer.save('metamers.pt', save_model_reduced=True)
        >>> metamer_copy = po.synth.Metamer.load('metamers.pt',
                                                 model_constructor=po.simul.PooledRGC.from_state_dict_reduced,
                                                 cache_dir="/home/user/Desktop/metamers/windows_cache")

        Plotting representation is another way of visualizing the
        representation error, while plotting signal is similar to
        plot_image_hist, but allows you to see whether there's any pattern of
        individual correspondence.

        Parameters
        ----------
        value : {'representation', 'signal'}
            Whether to compare the representations or signals
        batch_idx : int, optional
            Which index to take from the batch dimension
        channel_idx : int or None, optional
            Which index to take from the channel dimension. If None, we use all
            channels (assumed use-case is RGB(A) image).
        iteration : int or None, optional
            Which iteration to display. If None, the default, we show
            the most recent one. Negative values are also allowed.
        figsize : tuple, optional
            The size of the figure to create. Ignored if ax is not None
        ax : matplotlib.pyplot.axis or None, optional
            If not None, the axis to plot this representation on. If
            None, we create our own 1 subplot figure to hold it
        func : {'scatter', 'hist2d'}, optional
            Whether to use a scatter plot or 2d histogram to plot this
            comparison. When there are many values (as often happens when
            plotting signal), then hist2d will be clearer
        hist2d_nbins: int, optional
            Number of bins between 0 and 1 to use for hist2d
        hist2d_cmap : str or matplotlib colormap, optional
            Colormap to use for hist2d
        scatter_subsample : float, optional
            What percentage of points to plot. If less than 1, will select that
            proportion of the points to plot. Done to make visualization
            clearer. Note we don't do this randomly (so that animate looks
            reasonable).
