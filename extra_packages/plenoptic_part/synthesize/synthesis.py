    All synthesis methods share a variety of similarities and thus need
    to have similar methods. Some of these can be implemented here and
    simply inherited, some of them will need to be different for each
    sub-class and thus are marked as abstract methods here

    Parameters
    ----------
    base_signal : torch.Tensor or array_like
        A 4d tensor, this is the image whose representation we wish to
        match. If this is not a tensor, we try to cast it as one.
    model : torch.nn.Module or function
        The visual model or metric to synthesize with. See `MAD_Competition`
        for details.
    loss_function : callable or None, optional
        the loss function to use to compare the representations of the
        models in order to determine their loss. Only used for the
        Module models, ignored otherwise. If None, we use the default:
        the element-wise 2-norm. See `MAD_Competition` notebook for more
        details
    model_kwargs : dict
        if model is a function (that is, you're using a metric instead
        of a model), then there might be additional arguments you want
        to pass it at run-time. Note that this means they will be passed
        on every call.

              function and then gradually adding details and is probably
              what you want.

              scale separately (ignoring the others), then with respect
              to all of them at the end.

        We rely on a handful of attributes to do this, and take the
        following steps:

        1. Check if we've been synthesizing for at least
           ``self.loss_change_iter`` iterations.

        2a. If so, check whether the absolute difference between the most
           recent loss and the loss ``self.loss_change_iter`` iterations
           ago is less than ``self.loss_thresh``.

        2b. If not, return False

        3a. If so, check whether coarse_to_fine is not False.

        3b. If not, return False

        4a. If so, check whether we're synthesizing with respect to all
           scales and have been doing so for at least
           ``self.loss_change_iter`` iterations.

        4b. If not, return True

        extra arguments specific to the given synthesis method at the
        beginning

        FOLLOWING DOCUMENTATION APPLIES AS LONG AS YOU USE ALL THE ABOVE
        ARGUMENTS AND FOLLOW THE GENERAL STRUCTURE OUTLINED IN THIS
        FUNCTION

        Parameters
        ----------
        seed : int or None, optional
            Number with which to seed pytorch and numy's random number
            generators. If None, won't set the seed.
        max_iter : int, optinal
            The maximum number of iterations to run before we end
        learning_rate : float or None, optional
            The learning rate for our optimizer. None is only accepted
            if we're resuming synthesis, in which case we use the last
            learning rate from the previous instance.
        scheduler : bool, optional
            whether to initialize the scheduler or not. If False, the
            learning rate will never decrease.
        optimizer: {'GD', 'Adam', 'SGD', 'LBFGS', 'AdamW'}
            The choice of optimization algorithm. 'GD' is regular
            gradient descent.
        optimizer_kwargs : dict, optional
            Dictionary of keyword arguments to pass to the optimizer (in
            addition to learning_rate). What these should be depend on
            the specific optimizer you're using
        swa : bool, optional
            whether to use stochastic weight averaging or not, see
            https://pytorch.org/blog/pytorch-1.6-now-includes-stochastic-weight-averaging/
        swa_start : int, optional
            the iteration to start using stochastic weight iteration
        swa_freq : int, optional
            how frequently to update the parameters of the averaged model
        swa_lr : float, optional
            learning rate of the SWA
        clamper : plenoptic.Clamper or None, optional
            Clamper makes a change to the image in order to ensure that
            it stays reasonable. The classic example (and default
            option) is making sure the range lies between 0 and 1, see
            plenoptic.RangeClamper for an example.
        clamp_each_iter : bool, optional
            If True (and ``clamper`` is not ``None``), we clamp every
            iteration. If False, we only clamp at the very end, after
            the last iteration
        store_progress : bool or int, optional
            Whether we should store the representation of the metamer
            and the metamer image in progress on every iteration. If
            False, we don't save anything. If True, we save every
            iteration. If an int, we save every ``store_progress``
            iterations (note then that 0 is the same as False and 1 the
            same as True).
        save_progress : bool or int, optional
            Whether to save the metamer as we go. If True, we save to
            ``save_path`` every ``store_progress`` iterations. If an int, we
            save every ``save_progress`` iterations. Note that this can end up
            actually taking a fair amount of time.
        save_path : str, optional
            The path to save the synthesis-in-progress to (ignored if
            ``save_progress`` is False)
        loss_thresh : float, optional
            If the loss over the past ``loss_change_iter`` has changed
            less than ``loss_thresh``, we stop.
        loss_change_iter : int, optional
            loss has stopped decreasing in order to determine whether we
            should only calculate the gradient with respect to the
            ``loss_change_fraction`` fraction of statistics with
            the highest error.
        fraction_removed: float, optional
            The fraction of the representation that will be ignored
            when computing the loss. At every step the loss is computed
            using the remaining fraction of the representation only.
        loss_change_thresh : float, optional
            The threshold below which we consider the loss as unchanging
            in order to determine whether we should only calculate the
            gradient with respect to the
            ``loss_change_fraction`` fraction of statistics with
            the highest error.
        loss_change_fraction : float, optional
            If we think the loss has stopped decreasing (based on
            ``loss_change_iter`` and ``loss_change_thresh``), the
            fraction of the representation with the highest loss that we
            use to calculate the gradients
        coarse_to_fine : { 'together', 'separate', False}, optional
            If False, don't do coarse-to-fine optimization. Else, there
            are two options for how to do it:
            - 'together': start with the coarsest scale, then gradually
              add each finer scale.
            - 'separate': compute the gradient with respect to each
              scale separately (ignoring the others), then with respect
              to all of them at the end.
            (see ``Metamer`` tutorial for more details).
        clip_grad_norm : bool or float, optional
            Clip the gradient norm to avoid issues with numerical overflow.
            Gradient norm will be clipped to the specified value (True is
            equivalent to 1).

        ----------
        optimizer : {'GD', 'SGD', 'LBFGS', 'Adam', 'AdamW'}
            the optimizer to initialize.
        lr : float or None
            The learning rate for our optimizer. None is only accepted
            if we're resuming synthesis, in which case we use the last
            learning rate from the previous instance.
        scheduler : bool, optional
            whether to initialize the scheduler or not. If False, the
            learning rate will never decrease. Setting this to True
            seems to improve performance, but it might be useful to turn
            it off in order to better work through what's happening
        clip_grad_norm : bool or float, optional
            If the gradient norm gets too large, the optimization can
            run into problems with numerical overflow. In order to avoid
            that, you can clip the gradient norm to a certain maximum by
            setting this to True or a float (if you set this to False,
            we don't clip the gradient norm). If True, then we use 1,
            which seems reasonable. Otherwise, we use the value set

        We will iterate through any additional key word arguments
        provided and, if the model in the saved representation is a
        dictionary, add them to the state_dict of the model. In this
        way, you can replace, e.g., paths that have changed between
        where you ran the model and where you are now.

        Parameters
        ----------
        file_path : str
            The path to load the synthesis object from
        model_attr_name : str or list, optional
            The attribute that gives the model(s) names. Can be a str or
            a list of strs. If a list and the reduced version of the
            model was saved, ``model_constructor`` should be a list of
            the same length.
        model_constructor : callable, list, or None, optional
            When saving the synthesis object, we have the option to only
            save the ``state_dict_reduced`` (in order to save space). If
            we do that, then we need some way to construct that model
            again and, not knowing its class or anything, this object
            doesn't know how. Therefore, a user must pass a constructor
            for the model that takes in the ``state_dict_reduced``
            dictionary and returns the initialized model. See the
            VentralModel class for an example of this. If a list, should
            be a list of the above and the same length as
            ``model_attr_name``
        map_location : str, optional
            map_location argument to pass to ``torch.load``. If you save
            stuff that was being run on a GPU and are loading onto a
            CPU, you'll need this to make sure everything lines up
            properly. This should be structured like the str you would
            pass to ``torch.device``
        state_dict_kwargs :
            any additional kwargs will be added to the model's
            state_dict before construction (this only applies if the
            model is a dict, see above for more description of that)

        Returns
        -------
        synthesis : plenoptic.synth.Synthesis
            The loaded synthesis object


        Examples
        --------
        >>> metamer = po.synth.Metamer(img, model)
        >>> metamer.synthesize(max_iter=10, store_progress=True)
        >>> metamer.save('metamers.pt')
        >>> metamer_copy = po.synth.Metamer.load('metamers.pt')

        Things are slightly more complicated if you saved a reduced
        representation of the model by setting the
        ``save_model_reduced`` flag to ``True``. In that case, you also
        need to pass a model constructor argument, like so:

        >>> model = po.simul.PooledRGC(1)
        >>> metamer = po.synth.Metamer(img, model)
        >>> metamer.synthesize(max_iter=10, store_progress=True)
        >>> metamer.save('metamers.pt', save_model_reduced=True)
        >>> metamer_copy = po.synth.Metamer.load('metamers.pt',
                                                 model_constructor=po.simul.PooledRGC.from_state_dict_reduced)

        You may want to update one or more of the arguments used to
        initialize the model. The example I have in mind is where you
        run the metamer synthesis on a cluster but then load it on your
        local machine. The VentralModel classes have a ``cache_dir``
        attribute which you will want to change so it finds the
        appropriate location:

        >>> model = po.simul.PooledRGC(1)
        >>> metamer = po.synth.Metamer(img, model)

    def to(self, *args, attrs=[], **kwargs):
        r"""Moves and/or casts the parameters and buffers.

        Similar to ``save``, this is an abstract method only because you
        need to define the attributes to call to on.

        NOTE: We always call ``model.to(*args, **kwargs)`` (and thus
        ``'model'`` does not need to be in the ``attrs`` argument), but
        we only raise a Warning (not an Exception) if ``model`` does not
        have a ``to()`` method

        This can be called as

        .. function:: to(device=None, dtype=None, non_blocking=False)

        .. function:: to(dtype, non_blocking=False)

        .. function:: to(tensor, non_blocking=False)

        Its signature is similar to :meth:`torch.Tensor.to`, but only accepts
        floating point desired :attr:`dtype` s. In addition, this method will
        only cast the floating point parameters and buffers to :attr:`dtype`
        (if given). The integral parameters and buffers will be moved
        :attr:`device`, if that is given, but with dtypes unchanged. When
        :attr:`non_blocking` is set, it tries to convert/move asynchronously
        with respect to the host if possible, e.g., moving CPU Tensors with
        pinned memory to CUDA devices.

        .. note::
            This method modifies the module in-place.

        Args:
            device (:class:`torch.device`): the desired device of the parameters
                and buffers in this module
            dtype (:class:`torch.dtype`): the desired floating point type of
                the floating point parameters and buffers in this module
            tensor (torch.Tensor): Tensor whose dtype and device are the desired
                dtype and device for all parameters and buffers in this module

        We plot ``self.representation_error(iteration)``

        The goal is to use the model's ``plot_representation``
        method. However, in order for this to work, it needs to not only
        have that method, but a way to make a 'mock copy', a separate
        model that has the same initialization parameters, but whose
        representation we can set. For the VentralStream models, we can
        do this using their ``state_dict_reduced`` attribute. If we can't
        do this, then we'll fall back onto using ``plt.plot``

        In order for this to work, we also count on
        ``plot_representation`` to return the figure and the axes it
        modified (axes should be a list)

        Parameters
        ----------
        batch_idx : int, optional
            Which index to take from the batch dimension
        iteration: int or None, optional
            Which iteration to create the representation ratio for. If
            None, we use the current ``synthesized_representation``
        figsize : tuple, optional
            The size of the figure to create
        ylim : tuple or None, optional
            If not None, the y-limits to use for this plot. If None, we
            scale the y-limits so that it's symmetric about 0 with a
            limit of ``np.abs(representation_error).max()``
        ax : matplotlib.pyplot.axis or None, optional
            If not None, the axis to plot this representation on. If
            None, we create our own 1 subplot figure to hold it
        title : str, optional
            The title to put above this axis. If you want no title, pass
            the empty string (``''``)
        as_rgb : bool, optional
            The representation can be image-like with multiple channels, and we
            have no way to determine whether it should be represented as an RGB
            image or not, so the user must set this flag to tell us. It will be
            ignored if the representation doesn't look image-like or if the
            model has its own plot_representation_error() method. Else, it will
            be passed to `po.imshow()`, see that methods docstring for details.

        iteration : int or None, optional

        ax : matplotlib.pyplot.axis or None, optional
            If not None, the axis to plot this representation on. If
            None, we create our own 1 subplot figure to hold it
        func : {'scatter', 'hist2d'}, optional
            Whether to use a scatter plot or 2d histogram to plot this
            comparison. When there are many values (as often happens when
            plotting signal), then hist2d will be clearer
        hist2d_nbins: int, optional
            Number of bins between 0 and 1 to use for hist2d
        hist2d_cmap : str or matplotlib colormap, optional
            Colormap to use for hist2d
        scatter_subsample : float, optional
            What percentage of points to plot. If less than 1, will select that
            proportion of the points to plot. Done to make visualization

        We create several subplots to analyze this. By default, we create three
        subplots on a new figure: the first one contains the synthesized image,
        the second contains the loss, and the third contains the representation
        error.

        There are several optional additional plots: image_hist, rep_comparison, and
        signal_comparison:

        - image_hist contains a histogram of pixel values of the synthesized
          and base images.

        - rep_comparison is a scatter plot comparing the representation of the
          synthesized and base images.

        - signal_comparison is a scatter plot (by default) or 2d histogram (if
          signal_comp_func='hist2d') of the pixel values in the synthesized and
          base images.

        All of these (including the default plots) can be toggled using their
        corresponding boolean flags, and can be created separately using the
        method with the same name as the flag.

        You can specify what iteration to view by using the
        ``iteration`` arg. The default, ``None``, shows the final one.

        The loss plot shows the loss as a function of iteration for all
        iterations (even if we didn't save the representation or
        synthesized image at each iteration), with a red dot showing the
        location of the iteration.

        We use ``pyrtools.imshow`` to display the synthesized image and
        attempt to automatically find the most reasonable zoom
        value. You can override this value using the imshow_zoom arg,
        but remember that ``pyrtools.imshow`` is opinionated about the
        size of the resulting image and will throw an Exception if the
        axis created is not big enough for the selected zoom. We
        currently cannot shrink the image, so figsize must be big enough
        to display the image

        Parameters
        ----------
        batch_idx : int, optional
            Which index to take from the batch dimension

        iteration : int or None, optional
            Which iteration to display. If None, the default, we show
            the most recent one. Negative values are also allowed.
        figsize : tuple or None, optional
            The size of the figure to create. It may take a little bit of
            playing around to find a reasonable value. If None, we attempt to
            make our best guess, aiming to have each axis be of size (5, 5)
        ylim : tuple or None, optional
            The ylimit to use for the representation_error plot. We pass
            this value directly to ``self.plot_representation_error``
        plot_synthesized_image : bool, optional
            Whether to plot the synthesized image or not.
        plot_loss : bool, optional
            Whether to plot the loss or not.
        plot_representation_error : bool, optional
            Whether to plot the representation ratio or not.
        imshow_zoom : None or float, optional
            How much to zoom in / enlarge the synthesized image, the ratio
            of display pixels to image pixels. If None (the default), we
            attempt to find the best value ourselves. Else, if >1, must
            be an integer.  If <1, must be 1/d where d is a a divisor of
            the size of the largest image.
        vrange : tuple or str, optional
            The vrange option to pass to ``pyrtools.imshow``. See that
            function for details
        fig : None or matplotlib.pyplot.Figure
            if None, we create a new figure. otherwise we assume this is
            an empty figure that has the appropriate size and number of
            subplots
        plot_image_hist : bool, optional
            Whether to plot the histograms of image pixel intensities or
            not.
        plot_rep_comparison : bool, optional
            Whether to plot a scatter plot comparing the synthesized and base
            representation.
        plot_signal_comparison : bool, optional
            Whether to plot the comparison of the synthesized and base
            signal.
        signal_comp_func : {'scatter', 'hist2d'}, optional
            Whether to use a scatter plot or 2d histogram to plot this signal
            comparison. When there are many values (as often happens), then
            hist2d will be clearer
        signal_comp_subsample : float, optional
            What percentage of signal points to plot. If less than 1, will
            randomly select that proportion of the points to plot. Done to make
            visualization clearer.
        axes_idx : dict, optional
            Dictionary specifying which axes contains which type of plot,
            allows for more fine-grained control of the resulting figure.
            Probably only helpful if fig is also defined. Possible keys: image,
            loss, rep_error, hist, rep_comp, signal_comp, misc. Values should
            all be ints. If you tell this function to create a plot that doesn't

            already in the dict, so if you have axes that you want unchanged,
            place their idx in misc.
        plot_representation_error_as_rgb : bool, optional
            The representation can be image-like with multiple channels, and we
            have no way to determine whether it should be represented as an RGB
            image or not, so the user must set this flag to tell us. It will be
            ignored if the representation doesn't look image-like or if the
            model has its own plot_representation_error() method. Else, it will
            be passed to `po.imshow()`, see that methods docstring for details.

        r"""Animate synthesis progress.

        This is essentially the figure produced by
        ``self.plot_synthesis_status`` animated over time, for each stored
        iteration.

        We return the matplotlib FuncAnimation object. In order to view
        it in a Jupyter notebook, use the
        ``plenoptic.convert_anim_to_html(anim)`` function. In order to
        save, use ``anim.save(filename)`` (note for this that you'll
        need the appropriate writer installed and on your path, e.g.,
        ffmpeg, imagemagick, etc). Either of these will probably take a
        reasonably long amount of time.

        Parameters
        ----------
        batch_idx : int, optional
            Which index to take from the batch dimension
        channel_idx : int or None, optional
            Which index to take from the channel dimension. If None, we use all
            channels (assumed use-case is RGB(A) image).
        figsize : tuple or None, optional
            The size of the figure to create. It may take a little bit of
            playing around to find a reasonable value. If None, we attempt to
            make our best guess, aiming to have each axis be of size (5, 5)
        framerate : int, optional
            How many frames a second to display.
        ylim : str, None, or tuple, optional
            The y-limits of the representation_error plot (ignored if
            ``plot_representation_error`` arg is False).

            * If a tuple, then this is the ylim of all plots

            * If None, then all plots have the same limits, all
              symmetric about 0 with a limit of
              ``np.abs(representation_error).max()`` (for the initial
              representation_error)

            * If a string, must be 'rescale' or of the form 'rescaleN',
              where N can be any integer. If 'rescaleN', we rescale the
              limits every N frames (we rescale as if ylim = None). If
              'rescale', then we do this 10 times over the course of the
              animation

        plot_representation_error : bool, optional
            Whether to plot the representation ratio or not.
        imshow_zoom : int, float, or None, optional
            Either an int or an inverse power of 2, how much to zoom the
            images by in the plots we'll create. If None (the default), we
            attempt to find the best value ourselves.
        plot_data_attr : list, optional
            list of strs giving the names of the attributes with data
            plotted on the second subplot. this allows us to update
            whatever is in there if your plot_synthesis_status() plots
            something other than loss or if you plotted more than one
            attribute (e.g., MADCompetition plots two losses)
        rep_func_kwargs : dict, optional
            a dictionary of additional kwargs to pass through to the repeated
            calls to representation_error() or _grab_value_for_comparison()
            (for plotting representation error and representation comparison,
            respectively)
        plot_image_hist : bool, optional
            Whether to plot the histograms of image pixel intensities or
            not. Note that we update this in the most naive way possible
            (by clearing and replotting the values), so it might not
            look as good as the others and may take some time.
        plot_rep_comparison : bool, optional
            Whether to plot a scatter plot comparing the synthesized and base
            representation.
        plot_signal_comparison : bool, optional
            Whether to plot a 2d histogram comparing the synthesized and base
            representation. Note that we update this in the most naive way
            possible (by clearing and replotting the values), so it might not
            look as good as the others and may take some time.
        fig : plt.Figure or None, optional
            If None, create the figure from scratch. Else, should be an empty
            figure with enough axes (the expected use here is have same-size
            movies with different plots).
        signal_comp_func : {'scatter', 'hist2d'}, optional
            Whether to use a scatter plot or 2d histogram to plot this signal
            comparison. When there are many values (as often happens), then
            hist2d will be clearer
        signal_comp_subsample : float, optional
            What percentage of signal points to plot. If less than 1, will
            randomly select that proportion of the points to plot. Done to make
            visualization clearer.
        axes_idx : dict, optional
            Dictionary specifying which axes contains which type of plot,
            allows for more fine-grained control of the resulting figure.
            Probably only helpful if fig is also defined. Possible keys: image,
            loss, rep_error, hist, rep_comp, signal_comp, misc. Values should
            all be ints. If you tell this function to create a plot that doesn't
            have a corresponding key, we find the lowest int that is not
            already in the dict, so if you have axes that you want unchanged,
            place their idx in misc.
        init_figure : bool, optional
            If True, we call plot_synthesis_status to initialize the figure. If
            False, we assume fig has already been intialized with the proper
            plots (e.g., you already called plot_synthesis_status and are
            passing that figure as the fig argument). In this case, axes_idx
            must also be set and include keys for each of the included plots,
        plot_representation_error_as_rgb : bool, optional
            The representation can be image-like with multiple channels, and we
            have no way to determine whether it should be represented as an RGB
            image or not, so the user must set this flag to tell us. It will be
            ignored if the representation doesn't look image-like or if the
            model has its own plot_representation_error() method. Else, it will
            be passed to `po.imshow()`, see that methods docstring for details.
            since plot_synthesis_status normally sets it up for us
