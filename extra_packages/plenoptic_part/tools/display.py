    This plots the data, baseline, cleans up the axis, and sets the
    title

    Should not be called by users directly, but is a helper function for
    the various plot_representation() functions

    By default, stem plot would have a baseline that covers the entire
    range of the data. We want to be able to break that up visually (so
    there's a line from 0 to 9, from 10 to 19, etc), and passing xvals
    separately allows us to do that. If you want the default stem plot
    behavior, leave xvals as None.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : `np.ndarray`
        The data to plot (as a stem plot)
    ax : `matplotlib.pyplot.axis` or `None`, optional
        The axis to plot the data on. If None, we plot on the current
        axis
    title : str or None, optional
        The title to put on the axis if not None. If None, we don't call
        ``ax.set_title`` (useful if you want to avoid changing the title
        on an existing plot)
    ylim : tuple or None, optional
        If not None, the y-limits to use for this plot. If None, we
        use the default, slightly adjusted so that the minimum is 0
    xvals : `tuple` or `None`, optional
        A 2-tuple of lists, containing the start (``xvals[0]``) and stop
        (``xvals[1]``) x values for plotting. If None, we use the
        default stem plot behavior.
    kwargs :
        passed to ax.stem

    Returns
    -------
    ax : `matplotlib.pyplot.axis`
        The axis with the plot

    Example
    -------
    We allow for breaks in the baseline value if we want to visually
    break up the plot, as we see below.

    ..plot::
      :include-source:

      import plenoptic as po
      import numpy as np
      import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
      # if ylim=None, as in this example, the minimum y-valuewill get
      # set to 0, so we want to make sure our values are all positive
      y = np.abs(np.random.randn(55))
      y[15:20] = np.nan
      y[35:40] = np.nan
      # we want to draw the baseline from 0 to 14, 20 to 34, and 40 to
      # 54, everywhere that we have non-NaN values for y
      xvals = ([0, 20, 40], [14, 34, 54])
      po.tools.display.clean_stem_plot(y,  xvals=xvals)
      plt.show()

    the default xvals (``None``). In this case, this function will just
    clean up the plot a little bit

def update_plot(axes, data, model=None, batch_idx=0):
    r"""Update the information in some axes.

    This is used for creating an animation over time. In order to create
    the animation, we need to know how to update the matplotlib Artists,
    and this provides a simple way of doing that. It assumes the plot
    has been created by something like ``plot_representation``, which
    initializes all the artists.

    We can update stem plots, lines (as returned by ``plt.plot``), scatter
    plots, or images (RGB, RGBA, or grayscale).

    There are two modes for this:

    - single axis: axes is a single axis, which may contain multiple artists
      (all of the same type) to update. data should be a Tensor with multiple
      channels (one per artist in the same order) or be a dictionary whose keys
      give the label(s) of the corresponding artist(s) and whose values are
      Tensors.

    - multiple axes: axes is a list of axes, each of which contains a single
      artist to update (artists can be different types). data should be a
      Tensor with multiple channels (one per axis in the same order) or a
      dictionary with the same number of keys as axes, which we can iterate
      through in order, and whose values are Tensors.

    In all cases, data Tensors should be 3d (if the plot we're updating is a
    line or stem plot) or 4d (if it's an image or scatter plot).

    RGB(A) images are special, since we store that info along the channel
    dimension, so they only work with single-axis mode (which will only have a
    single artist, because that's how imshow works).

    If you have multiple axes, each with multiple artists you want to update,
    that's too complicated for us, and so you should write a
    ``model.update_plot()`` function which handles that.

    If ``model`` is set, we try to call ``model.update_plot()`` (which
    must also return artists). If model doesn't have an ``update_plot``
    method, then we try to figure out how to update the axes ourselves,
    based on the shape of the data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    axes : `list` or `matplotlib.pyplot.axis`
        The axis or list of axes to update. We assume that these are the axes
        created by ``plot_representation`` and so contain stem plots in the
        correct order.
    data : `torch.Tensor` or `dict`
        The new data to plot.
    model : `torch.nn.Module` or `None`, optional
        A differentiable model that tells us how to plot ``data``. See
        above for behavior if ``None``.
    batch_idx : int, optional
        Which index to take from the batch dimension

    Returns
    -------
    artists : `list`
        A list of the artists used to update the information on the
        plots

      and if it looks vector-like, we'll use ``plenoptic.clean_stem_plot``. If
      it's a dictionary, we'll assume each key, value pair gives the title and
      data to plot on a separate sub-plot.

    - If ``data`` is ``None``, we can only do something if
      ``model.plot_representation`` has some default behavior when
      ``data=None``; this is probably to plot its own ``representation``
      attribute. Thus, this will raise an Exception if both ``model`` and
      ``data`` are ``None``, because we have no idea what to plot then.

    - If ``ax`` is ``None``, we create a one-subplot figure using ``figsize``.
      If ``ax`` is not ``None``, we therefore ignore ``figsize``.

    - If ``ylim`` is ``None``, we call ``rescale_ylim``, which sets the axes'
      y-limits to be ``(-y_max, y_max)``, where ``y_max=np.abs(data).max()``.
      If it's ``False``, we do nothing.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : `torch.nn.Module` or None, optional
        A differentiable model that tells us how to plot ``data``. See
        above for behavior if ``None``.
    data : `array_like`, `dict`, or `None`, optional
        The data to plot. See above for behavior if ``None``.
    ax : matplotlib.pyplot.axis or None, optional
        The axis to plot on. See above for behavior if ``None``.
    figsize : `tuple`, optional
        The size of the figure to create. Ignored if ``ax`` is not
        ``None``.
    ylim : `tuple`, `None`, or `False`, optional
        If not None, the y-limits to use for this plot. See above for
        behavior if ``None``. If False, we do nothing.
    batch_idx : `int`, optional
        Which index to take from the batch dimension
    title : `str`, optional
        The title to put above this axis. If you want no title, pass
        the empty string (``''``)
    as_rgb : bool, optional
        The representation can be image-like with multiple channels, and we
        have no way to determine whether it should be represented as an RGB
        image or not, so the user must set this flag to tell us. It will be
        ignored if the representation doesn't look image-like or if the
        model has its own plot_representation_error() method. Else, it will
        be passed to `po.imshow()`, see that methods docstring for details.

    Returns
    -------
    fig : matplotlib.figure.Figure
        The figure containing the plot
