def generate_norm_stats(model, input_dir, save_path=None, img_shape=None, as_gray=True,
                        index=None):
    r"""Generate the statistics we want to use for normalization in models

    We sometimes want to normalize our models by whitening their
    internal representation (i.e., setting their mean to 0 and their
    covariance to the identity matrix). In practice, you need many
    samples to do this, but at the very least you can approximate this
    by z-scoring them, subtracting their mean and dividing by their
    standard deviation. In either case, to do this you need to get the
    model's statistics across a variety of images.

    This function will help you do that: by taking a model and an input
    directory, will load every image we find in that directory
    (non-recursively), and combine them into a giant 4d tensor. We then
    pass this to the model (so it must be able to work on batched
    images) to get its representation of all of these. If the model has
    a ``to_normalize`` attribute (a list of strings specifying which
    attributes you want to normalize), we'll go through and grab those
    attributes; otherwise we'll use the value returned by
    ``model(images)`` (i.e., from its forward method). This will be a
    dictionary with keys for each value of ``to_normalize`` or just
    ``"representation"`` if the model has no ``to_normalize``
    attribute. We then average so that we have a single value per batch
    and per channel (we should be able to figure out how many dimensions
    that requires averaging over), and save the resulting dictionary at
    save_path (if it's not None) and return it.

    Caveats / notes:

    - Since we're combining all the images into one tensor, they have to
      be the same shape. This is specified using ``img_shape`` (so it
      should be a tuple of ints) or, if it's None, inferred from the
      first image we load

    - The attributes contained within ``to_normalize`` or the value
      returned by ``model(images)`` must either be a tensor (with 2 or
      more dimensions) or a dictionary containing tensors (with 2 or
      more dimensions)

    - If you want to run this on a whole bunch of images, you may not be
      able to do it all at once for memory reasons. If that's the case,
      you can use the ``index`` arg. If you set that to a 2-tuple, we'll
      glob to find all the files in the folder (getting a giant list)
      and only go from index[0] to index[1] of them. In this case, make
      sure you do something yourself to save them separately and later
      concatenate them, because this function won't.

    In order to use this dictionary to actually z-score your statistics,
    use the ``zscore_stats`` function.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : torch.nn.Module
        The model we want to generate normalization statistics for.
    input_dir : str
        Path to a directory that contains the images we want to use for
        generating the statistics.
    save_path : str or None, optional
        If a str, the path (should end in '.pt') to save the statistics
        at. If None, we don't save.
    img_shape : tuple or None, optional
        The image shape we want to require that all images have. Since
        we're concatenating all the images into one big tensor, they
        need to have the same dimensions. If a tuple, we only add those
        images that match this shape. If None, we grab that shape from
        the first image we load in.
    as_gray : bool, optional
        If True, we convert any 3d images to grayscale using
        skimage.color.rgb2gray. If False, we do nothing
    index : tuple or None, optional
        If a tuple, must be a 2-tuple of ints. Then, after globbing to
        find all the files in a folder, we only go from index[0] to
        index[1] of them. If None, we go through all files

    Returns
    -------

def zscore_stats(stats_dict, model=None, **to_normalize):
    r"""zscore the model's statistics based on stats_dict

    We'd like to use the dictionary of statistics generated by
    ``generate_norm_stats`` to actually normalize some of the statistics
    in our model. This will take a model and the ``stats_dict``
    dictionary and z-score the appropriate attribute of the model
    (whether it's a dictionary or a tensor), subtacting off the mean of
    the value that's in ``stats_dict`` and dividing by the standard
    deviation.

    There are two (mutually-exclusive) ways to use this function:

    1. Pass a model, in which case we assume that the keys in
       ``stats_dict`` correspond to attributes of this model and we'll
       normalize any of them that are present in both ``stats_dict`` and
       as attributes of ``model``. In this case, we return a modified
       version of ``model``.

    2. Pass keyword arguments, in which case we'll assume these
       correspond to the keys in ``stats_dict``. In this case, we return
       a dictionary, ``normalized``, whose keys are the keywords passed
       to this function.

    NOTE: There's no clever way to figure out *when* you want this to be
    called, so you'll have to decide where to insert this in your
    ``model.forward()`` call based on *your* knowledge of the contents
    of ``stats_dict``

    Parameters
    ----------
    stats : dict
        A dictionary containing the statistics to use for normalization
        (as returned/saved by the ``generate_norm_stats`` function).
    model : torch.nn.Module or None, optional
