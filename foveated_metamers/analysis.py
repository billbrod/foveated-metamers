def summarize_trials(raw_behavioral_path):
    r"""Summarize trials in order to determine whether subject was correct or not.

    With this, we create a n_trials by 4 array with the following
    structure: [trial number, time of trial end, button pressed, time
    button press was recorded, time when image flashed off].

    If you're using pyglet, as assumed here, PsychoPy should accurately record
    the timing of button presses, and the button press should therefore lie
    between the time of trial end and time when image flashed off (which we
    check in this function), and should lie closer to the time of trial end, on
    the order of 1e-4 secs. Timing data is returned so you can check this.

    If you're using glfw, the button a subject presses during the response
    period will be time-stamped to line up with the beginning of the *next*
    event. Therefore, if everything is working correctly, the 2nd and 4th
    columns of this array should be basically identical, only differing by
    msecs.

    This array is used by the get_responses function to grab the data
    necessary for making the psychophysical curve.

    NOTE: I think whether this works depends on the PsychoPy mode (e.g.,
    pyglet, glfw) you use, so if you change that double-check this

    This function takes in the dataframe summarizing the stimuli, the

    dataframe summarizing each trial in the experiment. We have the
    following columns:
    - 'image_name': the name of the reference image to compare
      against this metamer in the experiment
    - 'image_left_1': the seed of the first image presented on the left
    - 'image_left_2': the seed of the second image presented on the left

    - 'image_right_2': the seed of the second image presented on the right
    - 'trial_number': the number of this trial
    - 'correct_response': whether the correct response was 1 (if image_left_1
      and image_left_2 are different) or 2 (if image_right_1 and image_right_2
      are different)
    - 'model': the model used to generate this metamer
    - 'trial_type': whether this trial was metamer_vs_metamer or
      metamer_vs_reference
    - 'unique_seed': for metamer_vs_reference trials, the seed of the metamer.

    - an additional column for each item in ``dep_variable``

    On some trials, one of the two images presented will be a
    metamer. In that case, their seed (as stored in ``df``) is
